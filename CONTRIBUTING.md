Thank you for your interest in contributing to undernightinbirth. If you'd like to contribute, here are a few things to note.

 - The repo tries to organize things based of folders and sections.
   Tools go into /tools/, documentations on files should go into /docs/,
   etc. Major guides will be designated as TITLE dot md in the root
   folder.
   
 - Tools are free to be dropped into the folder, but rearrangement will
   happen. Anything that is directly relevant and useful will be allowed
   to put in there, such as tools meant to directly edit UNI2 data,
   scripts, etc.
   
- - Other programs and tools that is not meant to
   specifically work for UNI2 and are general should not be put in here,
   but should be linked in some other document.
   
- If uploading data from the game (that is, specifically UNI2 and its prior iterations), it must not be data that more dubiously fall out of fair use and breaks infringement. For example, if we are to host /d/ file edits for hex editing, we will not be putting an entire file that has assets such as graphics and sounds (which would be too big for the repo anyway). Either a patch file, script file, or small files that only contain text/declarations will be used to offer such changes. This is a gray area anyway, as the future intent is to translate and document 

- - Things such as templates to replicate graphics from the game are fine as long as preexisting data like art is removed.
