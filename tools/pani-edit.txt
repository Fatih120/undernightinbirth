Step 1: Edit > Texture manager // Modifies all DDS sheets available in the .pat
Step 2: Edit: Part Editor // Select the "Parts" of effects to use, align a box border (make sure the center xy is right in the middle of the image)

MAIN EDITOR

"Pattern" is the slot of the "Effect" that you will be see in HA6, lasts for one frame (so Pattern = 1 frame)

Select Part is the "Slot ID" for a part for that frame - you can have a lot of "Parts" per frame layered over each other.

Part source ID is the #ID of the Part you made in the Part Editor; fill it in and adjust the values and scale where needed, or wait to adjust the scale in HA6.

"Sprite ID" becomes the "Select Pattern" ID. Be sure to use "add blend" if its a transparent effect (set to 1)

If you want a colored effect like how a lot of characters have it, set "Use Color" to the COLOR PALETTE INDEX ID for your character (out of the 255 colors)

DDS Files:
MUST be a multiple, ie the canvas size *should* at least be 512x512 (and divisible by ? needs investigating)
Feasible Encodings are
	BC3 (Linear DXT5 / sRGB DX10) - Low Quality + Artifacting
